            <h3><i>Remembering The '86 Mets -Greatest Team of All Time</i></h3>
            <p class="newsfeed_words">The 1986 New York Mets season was the Mets' 25th season in the National League. They improved from a 98–64 record in 1985 to finish the season with a franchise record 108–54 record, giving them the division title. They went on to defeat the Houston Astros in six games in the NLCS and the American League champion Boston Red Sox in seven games in the World Series. This is their last championship to date. Darryl Strawberry and Ron Darling made their debuts in 1983, followed by Dwight Gooden and Sid Fernandez in 1984, and Lenny Dykstra and Roger McDowell in 1985. The Mets hired Davey Johnson to manage the ballclub in 1984, resulting in a solid season with 90 victories and a second-place finish. The rise continued in 1985, as they netted 98 wins and finished the season only 3 games behind the St. Louis Cardinals.

                In the 1985–86 offseason, general manager Frank Cashen brought in Tim Teufel, a right-handed hitting infielder from the Minnesota Twins and Bob Ojeda, a left-handed pitcher from the Boston Red Sox. The Mets added them to an existing veteran core including along with former MVPs George Foster and Keith Hernandez, veteran catcher Gary Carter and speedsters Wally Backman and Mookie Wilson.
                
                With these acquisitions, many predicted an easy dominance within the division. For once, the pundits were right. During spring training, Davey Johnson said to his players that they were not only going to win, but that they would dominate. That meant winning the division by double digits. The Mets concluded the season winning a club record 108 games, two out of every three, and finishing the season 21 1/2 games in front of the Philadelphia Phillies.
                Month by Month
                April
                The Mets had a rocky start with a 2–3 record (including two extra-inning losses to the St. Louis Cardinals and Philadelphia Phillies respectively).[14] But when the Mets hosted Philadelphia at Shea Stadium a few days later, they kicked off an 11-game winning streak. Their toughest test in this stretch happened in St. Louis. On April 24, Howard Johnson hit a game-tying homer. A few games later, Wally Backman made a series-saving double-play. The Mets finished the month 13–3.

                May
                The Mets went 18-9 in May and ended the month with a season record of 31-12.

                June
                On June 10 against the Phillies when Tim Teufel hit a pinch-hit, game-winning grand slam.[15][16] The Mets went 19-9 during June and finished the month with a season record of 50-21.

                July
                On July 3 against Houston, Darryl Strawberry hit a game-tying home run. But it was Ray Knight who won the game with a homer of his own, after striking out in his first four at-bats. Dwight Gooden's first half performance was good enough for him to earn the honor of being named starting pitcher for the National League in the All-Star Game in the Astrodome. This game marked the end of a streak where the NL won 13 of the previous 14 games and served as foreshadowing for what would happen next. Later in the month, the Mets lost three of four to the Astros. During this series, four Mets were arrested at a popular nightclub in Houston. Their fortunes improved in a bizarre game in Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium on July 22. In the top of the ninth, Dave Parker dropped the ball that could have been the final out for the Reds, allowing the Mets to tie the game. In the bottom of the tenth, Eric Davis got to third and brawled with Ray Knight. Both men, along with Kevin Mitchell and Mario Soto, were ejected. Johnson was forced to alternate Jesse Orosco and Roger McDowell in the outfield. In the bottom of the twelfth, Carl Willis bunted into a double-play. In the top of the fourteenth, Howard Johnson hit a home run to put the Mets on top. The Mets went 16-11 during July and finish the month with a season record of 66-32 and were up by 15.5 games in the NL East division.

                August
                Former MVP George Foster was released. Former Mets favorite Lee Mazzilli returned. Gary Carter was injured. While he was gone, the Mets won 8 of 11 games. The Mets went 21-11 in August and end with a season record to that point of 87-43 and be up by 19 games in the NL East division.

                September–October
                When they got to Philadelphia, droves of Mets fans were there to see if they would clinch the NL East.[17] In fact, they seemed to take up half of Veterans Stadium.[18] Given what had happened to them when they got swept in a three-game series in Philadelphia preceding the series and not wanting to see visiting teams win a division title on their field,[17] the Phillies swept the Mets. During the series, Mets fans at Veterans Stadium became unruly and damaged seats in the upper deck (the 700 level).[19] One Mets fan was arrested after striking at two Philadelphia police officers.[19] The Phillie Phanatic summed up the Mets being swept by crushing three Mets helmets in front of the Mets dugout during the final game of the series.[19] The Phillies ended up being the only team in the league to post a winning record against the Mets, going 10–8, with a 7–2 mark at Veterans Stadium. During the post-season awards, the Mets rivalry with the Phillies and that series was played out again, as it was Mike Schmidt of the Phillies who won the National League MVP Award, ahead of the Carter, who finished third, and Keith Hernandez, who finished fourth. It was Schmidt's third career MVP.[20]

                The Mets then split a two-game series St. Louis, trimming the magic number to clinch to 1 on September 16. The following day, they faced Dennis Eckersley and the Chicago Cubs. With a flu-ridden Hernandez, Dave Magadan was the offensive source of the day. Hernandez returned in the 9th to get the final out.[21] The champagne was popped immediately while the fans invaded the field quickly.[22] The Mets won a team-record 108 games after defeating the Pirates.[23]

                The Mets went 21-11 during the final two months and end the season with a record of 108-54 while winning the NL East division by 21.5 games.
